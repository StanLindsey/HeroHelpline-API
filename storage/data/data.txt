One of the worst things you can do in life is assume other people think the same way as you do
Are as constructively creative as they are destructive
Can be simultaneously both dangerous and friendly. Exercise extreme caution when dealing with these creatures
Lose physical fitness just as quickly as they gain it
Can remain mentally juvenile even after entering their adult life stage
Are squishy
Can hold opposing viewpoints at any given instance
Can hold a respect for authority, whilst rallying against it
Can hold hatred for those that wish to help them
Can convince themselves of anything
Remain playful up until the point of death
Can adapt and overcome perilous scenarios in order to survive
Are capable of more than what was previously thought possible
Are sometimes greater than the sum of their parts
